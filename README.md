Interactive website made for a school assignment

This was my first attempt at making a website for a school assignment. It is basically a website for an adoption center.

Basic things a client can do is as follows:
  1- Create an account (where credentials are stored in the login.txt file) (Duplicate credentials are not accepted)
  2- Set up a pet for adoption using the account they used to login
  3- Browse for pets to adopt
  4- Navigate the website for tips on pets, contact information and disclamers

All of this was made using HTML, CSS and Node.js
