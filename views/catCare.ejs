            <h4>Caring for cats</h4>
                <p class="longPara">
                    Cats are wonderful companions. Each has a unique personality â€“ just like people!
                    Some are shy and quiet while others are outgoing and social; but no matter the personality of your cat, 
                    they always rely on you as a guardian to provide a good home with what they need to be happy. Remember, a healthy 
                    cat is a happy cat
                </p>
